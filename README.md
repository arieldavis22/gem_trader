Gem Trader is a simple game for collecting and selling cards. Cards are themed with various gems. A player can buy a box of cards and hope for the rarest, most highly-valued gem cards.

## About the Developers
Ariel Davis and Laura Archambault created this app while students at Flatiron School, Atlanta campus. The project assignment was to create a Rails application, both front- and backend using 5 models. Students were to demonstrate an understanding of ActiveRecord and the MVC pattern.

We are excited to showcase this project after just six weeks of instruction. Building on the instruction we received in class, we self-taught rudimentary probability, CSS, and a few complex Ruby/HTML operators.
